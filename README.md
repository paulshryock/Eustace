This starter package leverages a front end boilerplate, kitchen sink, and some sensible styling defaults to avoid typing the same things for each project.

The goal is for every project to possess the following qualities:

- **Accessible**: Content is accessible to everyone, regardless of ableness
- **Client-agnostic**: Content is accessible on every device, operating system, browser or non-browser client (i.e. RSS reader, "Read Only" mode, etc.)
- **Connection-agnostic**: Content is accessible while offline, once cached
- **Content-agnostic**: Markup, styles, and scripts work with all types of content
- **Device-agnostic**: Content is not styled or optimized for certain devices, but rather styled and optimized for any device
- **Flexible**
- **Inclusive**
- **JavaScript-agnostic**: Content and functionality are accessible without JavaScript
- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile, enhance for larger screens
- **Performant**: Content loads in under 2000ms
- **Progressively-Enhanced**: Enhance markup and styling in browsers and environments supporting modern layout methods and JavaScript features, instead of breaking layouts and features in non-supporting environments
- **Responsive**: Look good on all devices and screen sizes
- **Secure**
- **Simple**: Reduce complexity wherever possible
- **Style-agnostic**: Content and functionality are accessible without CSS; source order always makes sense
- **Zero Dependencies**: Get up and running without any build tools, pre-processors, or 3rd-party scripts
