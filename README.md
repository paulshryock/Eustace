# Hello World Front End
> Start from scratch without reinventing the wheel

This starter package leverages a front end boilerplate, kitchen sink, and some sensible styling defaults to avoid typing the same things for each project.

## Installing / Getting started

<!-- A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running. -->

```shell
git clone https://github.com/paulshryock/Hello-World-Front-End Hello-World-Front-End
cd Hello-World-Front-End
open index.html
```

<!-- Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does. -->
